Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Description

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player can challenge an AI opponent. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the goal is to align three symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The AI uses basic strategy (or a smarter algorithm if implemented) to compete against the player. The game ends when a player wins or the board is full, resulting in a draw.
